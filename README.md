# methylCC

### Why use methylCC? 

This is a package to estimate the cell composition 
    of whole blood in DNA methylation measured on any 
    platform technology (e.g. Illumina 450K microarray, 
    whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and 
    reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)). 

For help with the **methylCC** R-package, there is a vignette available in the /vignettes folder.
